      <h2>My name is Andrew Roland and welcome to my page!</h2>
      <p>I currently live in San Antonio, TX but grew up in the Mid-West</p>
        <p>Currently I work as an Elementary Physical Education Teacher but I've decided to take the leap into Full Stack Development. 
          I know that this will be a challenge but I'm excited to tackle this new endeavour.</p>

      <h2>Who is Andrew Roland</h2>
        <p>I've made a unique journey to get to where I am today. My family is filled with former teachers, my mom taught 3rd grade and my dad taught Middle School.</p>
          <p>I swore that I would never be a teacher but it seems that I fell into the family business. My original degree is in Psychology and then I went back to 
          school to get my teaching certificate.</p> 
          
          <p>I love being active and playing but it's time for a change and I'm excited to join the field of computer programers.
          I love the challenges and the problem solving that comes with being a developer and I also enjoy the collaboration when trying to solve those problems.</p>
        
      <p>Outside of the computer world I enjoy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Being active and playing sports with friends.</li>
        <li>Working at Summer Camps.</li>
        <li>Spending time with my wife.</li>
      </ul>
